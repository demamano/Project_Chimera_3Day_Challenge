## Spec-Driven Development Approach

This project follows strict SDD principles:

1. **Specifications First**: All features start with detailed specs in `/specs`
2. **Clear Requirements**: Each spec defines acceptance criteria
3. **Test-Driven**: Tests are written based on specs before implementation
4. **Documentation**: Every feature is documented before coding
5. **Tracking**: All work is tracked via todo lists and analytics

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- VSCode with TenX Feedback Analytics configured
- Node.js or Python (depending on implementation)

### Project Setup

1. Review specifications in `./specs/`
2. Check implementation requirements in `./docs/`
3. Run tests from `./tests/`
4. Follow the todo list for development progress

## Development Workflow

1. **Specification Phase**: Define requirements in `specs/`
2. **Documentation Phase**: Document in `docs/`
3. **Test Phase**: Write tests in `tests/`
4. **Implementation Phase**: Code in `src/`
5. **Review Phase**: Validate against specs

## Tracking

Work progress is tracked using:
- **Todo Lists**: Organized task tracking
- **TenX Analytics**: Performance and competency metrics
- **Git**: Version control and change history
